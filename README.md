   Hello tech enthusiast I'm excited to share my first self made project, a facebook clone. Yes it's not perfect but this is my first step towards becoming skilled Web Developer

   Also the project looks best in full screen mode beacause I've used absolute positioning in many cases. I'll make sure to use flexbox attribute next time.

   Thank You for your support guyz

   Cheers!!
